This simple calculator was created using HTML, CSS, and JS. For styling, Tailwind CSS is used.\
Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus are its five fundamental operations.\
The input fields can also be cleared using the clear button. A result section is also included to display the outcome of the operation.\
My GitHub profile is linked in the footer as well. It is responsive and compatible with all platforms.\
In addition, GitHub Pages hosts it. Check it out right here. Moreover, it is open source.\
The code is available here for review. You can also contribute to it.
